    """LSTMModel class extends nn.Module class and works as a constructor for LSTMs.

       LSTMModel class initiates a LSTM module based on PyTorch's nn.Module class.
       It has only two methods, namely init() and forward(). While the init()
       method initiates the model with the given input parameters, the forward()
       method defines how the forward propagation needs to be calculated.
       Since PyTorch automatically defines back propagation, there is no need
       to define back propagation method.

       Attributes:
           hidden_dim (int): The number of nodes in each layer
           layer_dim (str): The number of layers in the network
           lstm (nn.LSTM): The LSTM model constructed with the input parameters.
           fc (nn.Linear): The fully connected layer to convert the final state
                           of LSTMs to our desired output shape.
